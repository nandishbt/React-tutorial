# Notes



### CRA -> Create React App
        It is a Bundler having all things needed to create react app but it is very bulky it had so many things which we may not used in project and it had testing dependencies installed.

### Vite -> vite@latest
        It is a modern build tool (Bundler) that is faster and more flexible than Create React App. It is a modern build tool and it is not as bulky as Create React App. It has built-in support for JSX, TypeScript, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, and more.
